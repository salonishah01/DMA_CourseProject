# MilleniumGoals

This is code used for my entries in the United Nations Millenium Development Goals
competition (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/1/).  I'm currently sitting
at 3rd/987 competitors using linear regression, a custom g-h Tracker (Kalman filter)
that I wrote, and spotting some issues with the data.  Many more ideas to try!
